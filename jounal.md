<h2 id="Day_one"> Day One</h2>
<p>The first day of class, I feel the thing that was the most valuable that I learned was, Github.com. We walked through how to create a quick webpage to push out a product. we went through the steps nessasary to enter simple commands and how to bring in a background as well. we went through some basic termonoligy to be able to make text bold, headers, and italics.
<h2 id="Day_two"> Day Two</h2>
<p>On the second day of class we have primarily focused on how to bring out work over from Github to VS code. this allows us to work in the command terminal in VS code then use Ubuntu to add the files we update there back to Github.
