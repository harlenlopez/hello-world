<h2 id="Day_one"> Day One</h2>
<p>The first day of class, I feel the thing that was the most valuable that I learned was, Github.com. We walked through how to create a quick webpage to push out a product. we went through the steps nessasary to enter simple commands and how to bring in a background as well. we went through some basic termonoligy to be able to make text bold, headers, and italics.
<h2 id="Day_two"> Day Two</h2>
<p>On the second day of class we have primarily focused on how to bring out work over from Github to VS code. this allows us to work in the command terminal in VS code then use Ubuntu to add the files we update there back to Github.
<h2 id="Day_three"> Day Three</h2>
<p>Day three of class, i am learning about CSS. more specificially, how to make changes to HTML as far as the color of text and the backgrounds. I am also learning how to make changes to adjacent sibling selectors as well. this process helps to clean your code up as not to have to write the same thing for each instance throughout the page. the book outlines how to either write CSS on the same page or link it from a seperate page to the HTML document., the latter is prefered so you can view them seperatly and help jkeep things orginized. 
We also learned how to impliment Java to build a a webpage with images, and active "welcome" message dependent on the time of day. we created a .css folder, .html folder and a .js folder to handle each aspect of the page Independently.
